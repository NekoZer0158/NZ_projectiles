Base:
	Projectile - base class for projectiles, doesn't have module support.
	Projectile_extended - a subclass of class Projectile, has module support, and also has an ID.
	name_hit - the name for the function, that will be called, in a node in which the projectile entered.
	(usually it's CharacterBody2D). By default it's "hit".
	The plugin doesn't contain tools to spawn projectiles because it's assumed that you will do them
	yourself (don't forget to set "type" for a projectile before spawning it).

Modules:
	Module - name for the resources, used by Projectile_extended.
	You can use them only in Projectile_extended.
	Atk_change_projectile - base for changing projectile damage.
	Speed_change_projectile - base for changing projectile speed.
	Move_extended_projectile - base for changing projectile movement.
	Hit_extended_projectile - base for changing arguments for the "hit" function.
	Remove_projectile - base for changing consequences for projectile when body enters it.

In the folder "NZ_projectiles/Scenes", you can find scenes in which you can see different variants of
how you can use projectiles. In the scene "Sandbox" you can try out different stuff with projectiles.
I recommend checking scripts, where you can find information about some variables and functions.
